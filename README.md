## Star Debug

Mobile app for Android to make it easier to handle your Starlink.

It can:
- Decode Starlink debug data.
- Show online data from connected Starlink

More projects on Starlink monitoring:
- Python UI to view Debug Data: https://github.com/olegkutkov/Space-Debugger
- Prometheus exporter for Starlink data:

### Reproducible builds

The build process appears to be very fragile. To receive the same binary, it is required:
- Precisely reproduce versions of Flutter SDK and related tools (Android SDK for Android, XCode for iOS, etc.)
- Use exactly the same paths: source, libs, etc.
- There are possible issues with concurrent builds (but it looks like it is a rare issue nowadays).

Moreover, files generated by a build process are often not the same files your phone downloads from the market.

In the Android world, for example, you build an AppBundle file, from which Google Play generates a bunch of APKs
for different hardware, screen sizes, languages, etc. 
As a result, under the hood, you download a set of APKs selected for your particular device. 

In the iOS world, Apple encrypts the code of the app directly for your device, and it is not possible 
to get original binaries without jailbreaking your phone. 

As a result, we cannot guarantee that everyone can successfully reproduce and verify published builds.

For those who are brave enough to try, the best-effort instructions are [here](_build/reproducible/reproducible_builds.md).

For those who care about and failed to verify a particular build, 
you can always build the app for yourself from the source code from this repository. 
The steps described in [the instructions](_build/reproducible/reproducible_builds.md) mentioned above, 
will help you to build your own binary.
